## Game

The number guessing game greets players with a friendly welcome message and now gives feedback on how close your guess is:

- **Warm** if you are within 10 numbers of the target.
- **Cold** otherwise.
- Wrong guesses get a random funny reaction to keep the game entertaining.
- Terminal messages are color-coded using ANSI escape codes for easier readability.
